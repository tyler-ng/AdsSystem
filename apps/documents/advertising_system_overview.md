# Advertising System - Business Features Overview

## What Our Advertising System Does

Our advertising system helps businesses show their ads to mobile app users. We connect companies who want to advertise with mobile apps that can display those ads, and we track how well the ads perform.

## Core Business Features

### 1. Campaign Creation for Business Partners

When a business partner wants to advertise with us, we create a **Campaign** for them. Each campaign includes:

**Basic Campaign Information:**
- Campaign name and description
- Company name of the advertiser
- Start and end dates for when ads should run
- Budget limits (how much they want to spend per day and in total)
- Daily spending limits prevent overspending in a single day

**Campaign Status Management:**
- **Draft**: Campaign is being set up but not running yet
- **Active**: Campaign is live and showing ads to users
- **Paused**: Campaign is temporarily stopped
- **Completed**: Campaign has finished running
- **Archived**: Campaign is stored for historical records

### 2. Creative Ad Types

We support different types of advertisements that businesses can create:

**Banner Ads**
- Small rectangular ads that appear at the top or bottom of mobile apps
- Common sizes: 320×50 pixels (mobile banner) or 728×90 pixels (tablet banner)
- Best for brand awareness and simple promotions

**What Each Creative Ad Contains:**
- Title and description text
- Images or videos
- Link to advertiser's website or app store
- Specific dimensions for proper display

### 3. Ad Placement Management

**What is Ad Placement?**
Ad placements are specific locations within mobile apps where advertisements can appear.

**How We Manage Placements:**
- We define different spots in mobile apps where ads can be shown
- Each placement has recommended sizes for ads
- We track which placements perform better for different types of ads
- App developers can choose which placements to include in their apps

**Examples of Placements:**
- Top banner in a news app
- Between levels in a game
- Bottom of a shopping app screen
- Pop-up when opening an app

### 4. Targeting Options for Campaigns

We help businesses reach the right audience by targeting ads based on:

**Demographics:**
- Age groups (e.g., 18-25, 26-35, etc.)
- Gender (male, female, or all users)
- Geographic location (specific countries, regions, or cities)

**Device Information:**
- Type of phone or tablet (iPhone, Android, etc.)
- Operating system versions
- Screen sizes

**User Interests:**
- Categories like sports, technology, fashion, food, etc.
- Based on app usage patterns and preferences

### 5. Advertisement Performance Tracking

Our system automatically tracks how well ads are performing:

**Impression Tracking**
- **What it is**: Every time an ad is shown to a user, we count it as one "impression"
- **What we track**: 
  - How many times each ad was displayed
  - When and where it was shown
  - What type of device viewed it
  - Geographic location of viewers

**Click Tracking**
- **What it is**: When a user taps on an ad, we count it as a "click"
- **What we measure**:
  - Click-through rate (CTR): Percentage of people who click after seeing an ad
  - Which ads get clicked most often
  - What time of day gets more clicks

**Display Rate Calculation**
- **What it measures**: How often we actually show a campaign's ads when we have opportunities
- **How we calculate it**:
  1. We sample a small percentage (5%) of all ad request opportunities
  2. For these sampled opportunities, we track:
     - How many times we could have shown the campaign's ad
     - How many times we actually chose to show it
  3. Display Rate = (Times Shown ÷ Total Opportunities) × 100
- **Why this matters**: Helps businesses understand how competitive their ads are and how often users see them

**Performance Reports Include:**
- Daily impression counts
- Total clicks and click-through rates
- Display rates and opportunity metrics
- Geographic performance breakdown
- Device type performance
- Time-of-day performance patterns

### 6. Budget and Cost Management

**How Budget Controls Work:**
- Daily spending limits prevent overspending in a single day
- Total campaign budget caps ensure campaigns don't exceed overall limits
- Real-time budget tracking shows current spending
- Automatic campaign pausing when budgets are reached

**Cost Tracking:**
- Cost per impression (CPM)
- Cost per click (CPC)
- Total campaign spending
- Remaining budget alerts
